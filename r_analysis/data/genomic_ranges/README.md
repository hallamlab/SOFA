# Contents:

* [EcoliSim2_dups_gr.txt](EcoliSim2_dups_gr.txt): Genomic ranges of simulated reads falling within CDS ranges from *E. coli* simulation (i.e., duplicates)
* [EcoliSim2_dups_sofa_60.txt](EcoliSim2_dups_sofa_60.txt): Genomic ranges of simulated reads falling within CDS ranges from *E. coli* simulation (i.e., duplicates) merged with SOFA results for deduplication 
* [NC_000613.3_CDS_gr.txt](EcoliSim2_dups_gr.txt): E. coli CDS ranges translated into ggbio Genomic Ranges format
